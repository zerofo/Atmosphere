## What does "June 15th" mean?
When Atmosphère began development in February 2018, "June 15" was given as the estimate/target date for a first release, to coincide with the planned disclosure of a vulnerability.

This deadline was missed, hard.

People made rather a lot of fun of me (SciresM) for this.

Several months later, when the first Atmosphère release occurred, I captioned it "Happy June 15th!" and pretended like I hadn't missed the first deadline.

This amused me a lot, and so the practice has been kept up for every single release since.

Depending on who you ask, you may be told that this is a dumb joke and it is not funny.

This is incorrect. It is definitely a dumb joke, but it is also hilarious.
